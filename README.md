Experimenting with a language where every routine is a coroutine.

Nearly all languages that support coroutines have bolted them onto an existing
language. Very often, it is done it a way that supports a specific use case in
a specific manner.

Can we generalize coroutines in such a way that we no longer need the
distinction between coroutines and other routines? Can we support multiple use
cases in a general way?
